          You are not alone. As summer begins and we transition from a season of reaction to one of reflection, we have more time and space to recognize how our lives and approach to teaching are forever changed.

        <p className="mt-4">As we process all that is happening to us as individuals this summer, as educators we are tasked with rethinking how changes to our instructional environments will impact our students. Some of this is tactical. Much more is emotional.</p>
        <p className="mt-4">Itâ€™s OK not to feel OK about everything. In fact, recognizing our social and emotional state is a precondition to learning, growth and project completion. This is especially true for our students.</p>
        <p className="mt-4">We invite you to participate in a facilitated conversation where you share with our community how you are approaching the project of rethinking your fall 2020 classroom.</p>
        <p className="mt-4">Throughout, you will be encouraged to share how your feelings are impacting your focus and ability to master that project. As the WorkFlowEdu team facilitates these conversations, we will incorporate what we all learn together into a task-management application that focuses on both feelings and functions.</p>

        <h3 className="text-lg lg:text-xl font-normal text-gray-700">
          Workflow Edu is a repository of resources related to planning your hour, day, or year. The guidance from any given Workflow might draw from theories around executive functioning, social and emotional learning, or just personal intuition. The goal in using these Workflows is to <span className="text-gray-600 italic">feel good and function well</span>.

              <p className="font-semibold text-xl">Enabling Exploration, Experimentation</p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                Given the huge variety of approaches taken to work most effectively, the likelihood is low that you'll find a Workflow that resonates with you on day one. Our tools for remixing a Workflow, plus sharing and search, allow for the huge variety of approaches to be expressed by one person and discovered by another.

              <p className="font-semibold text-xl">Community Contributions</p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                Every member of the Workflow Edu community is a potential contributor. That unique workflow you use to find motivation on those days where it feels like nothing is coming easy - it could be the next big one shared from person to person!

              <p className="mt-4">
                Nothing is more important than ensuring nothing that could have a negative effect gets put in front of students. That's why each Workflow must be explicitly admitted onto the platform by the community, a purposefully higher standard than those used on YouTube and other platforms.
